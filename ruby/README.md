# Ruby

Ruby is a fun PL and it is quite elegant from the beginning.

The book **Exercises in Programming Style** is very interesting. It summarizes common **coding patterns**, consisting of a simple program implemented in 33 different programming styles. This idea is inspired by this collection: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercises_in_Style>
