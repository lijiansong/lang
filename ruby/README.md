# Ruby

Ruby is a fun PL and it is quite elegant from the beginning.

The book **Exercises in Programming Style** is very interesting. It summarizes common **coding patterns**, consisting of a simple program implemented in 33 different programming styles. This idea is inspired by this collection: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercises_in_Style>.

The inspiration is a book from the 1940s by the French writer Raymond Queneau called Exercises in Style. In it, he tells the same short story in 99 different styles. Exercises in Programming Style uses the same concept, but implements a short program in 33 different programming styles. Each style is defined by what constraints it imposes on the program.
