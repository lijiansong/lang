# Violin Plot

Violin plot draws a combination of boxplot and kernel density estimate.

A violin plot plays a similar role as a box and whisker plot. It shows the distribution of quantitative data across several levels of one (or more) categorical variables such that those distributions can be compared. Unlike a box plot, in which all of the plot components correspond to actual datapoints, the violin plot features a kernel density estimation of the underlying distribution.

This can be an effective and attractive way to show multiple distributions of data at once, but keep in mind that the estimation procedure is influenced by the sample size, and violins for relatively small samples might look misleadingly smooth.
